Created a pokedex app which fetches all its data from the pokeapi website. The list screen consists of a search bar to find any particular pokemon and a scrollable list below it. Clicking on a pokemon takes it
to another screen which includes more structured details of the pokemon such as type, weight, height, and other base stats which are given an animation.

API Data is retrieved from: https://pokeapi.co/

Architecture is MVVM
